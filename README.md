# My Maven Repository

# âš  TIME TO MIGRATE TO [GITHUB PACKAGES](https://github.com/features/packages).

This git repository used to store artifacts will no longer be available. The lastest version of artifacts are removed to remind users to read this README.md again.

# Usage

** ðŸ’¡ Remember to replace `<library name>` and `<import statement>` to the correct value according to the documentation of the library you want to import.**

(If you think you are using a relatively new Android Studio, you can just read the next section)

Import the library in app(module-level) build.gradle:

```groovy
dependencies {
    repositories {
        // ðŸ‘‡
        maven {
            url 'https://maven.pkg.github.com/ryuunoakaihitomi/<library name>'
            credentials {
                username = 'ryuunoakaihitomi'
                password = 'ghp_extQ2D8b8NztcmmUyMzngcthP2VYJm0cEGS\u0020'
            }
        }
    }
    <import statement> // ðŸ‘ˆ
    // ...
}
```

### For Android studio Arctic Fox 2020.3.1+

If you encountered this error,
> Build was configured to prefer settings repositories over project repositories but repository 'maven' was added by build file 'app\build.gradle'

you have to perform it in two steps...

â‘  Import the maven repository in settings.gradle:

```groovy
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        // ...
        // ðŸ‘‡
        maven {
            url 'https://maven.pkg.github.com/ryuunoakaihitomi/<library name>'
            credentials {
                username = 'ryuunoakaihitomi'
                password = 'ghp_extQ2D8b8NztcmmUyMzngcthP2VYJm0cEGS\u0020'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

â‘¡ Import the library in app(module-level) build.gradle

```groovy
dependencies {
    // ...
    <import statement> // ðŸ‘ˆ
}
```

# Legacy Usage

    repositories {
        maven {
            url 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryuunoakaihitomi/maven-repository/master'
        }
